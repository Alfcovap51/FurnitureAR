# FurnitureAR
An augmented reality app to try furnitures at your home 

This app was made using Unity's ARFoundation. The idea of the app came from the IKEA PLACE app (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.inter_ikea.place&hl=en_CA)

You will need the following plugins to run the project.
